# component-experiment
an experiment with making something like a plugin system

This was a proof-of-concept made for [audio-visualizer-python](https://github.com/djfun/audio-visualizer-python) and contains some copy-pasted code from there. Therefore this repo is under the same licence as audio-visualizer-python (MIT licence).
